```{r}
data.all <- rio::import(here::here("data", "synthetic_data.csv"))
data.all$schoolid <- factor(data.all$schoolid)
```

The dataset exhibits two methodological challenges:

 - Selection effects exist even though the National Study itself was an RCT. In order to identify causal effects, we assume unconfoundedness (treatment assignment is as good as random conditioning on covariates). To relax this assumption, one could try IV or conduct a sensitivity analysis for hidden confoundings.
 
 - Students are nested in schools. We assume that student outcome within a same school may be arbitrarily correlated within a school, then apply cluster-robust analysis tools

Cluster-robust random forest 

 - causal forests are an adaptation of the random forest algorithm of Breiman (2001) to the problem of heterogeneous treatment effect estimation
 
 - explanation of this method see the article
 
### 1. Main analysis
 
```{r}
# It appears that school ID does not affect pscore. So ignore it
# in modeling, and just treat it as source of per-cluster error.

DF = data.all[,-1]
school.id = as.numeric(data.all$schoolid)
school.mat = model.matrix(~ schoolid + 0, data = data.all)
school.size = colSums(school.mat)
```

Fit a logit regression model (Z is binary):

```{r}
w.lm = glm(Z ~ ., data = data.all[,-3], family = binomial)
summary(w.lm)
```


```{r}
W = DF$Z
Y = DF$Y
X.raw = DF[,-(1:2)]

C1.exp = model.matrix(~ factor(X.raw$C1) + 0)
XC.exp = model.matrix(~ factor(X.raw$XC) + 0)

X = cbind(X.raw[,-which(names(X.raw) %in% c("C1", "XC"))], C1.exp, XC.exp)
```

#### Causal forest

```{r}
Y.forest = regression_forest(X, Y, clusters = school.id, equalize.cluster.weights = TRUE)
Y.hat = predict(Y.forest)$predictions
W.forest = regression_forest(X, W, clusters = school.id, equalize.cluster.weights = TRUE)
W.hat = predict(W.forest)$predictions

cf.raw = causal_forest(X, Y, W,
                       Y.hat = Y.hat, W.hat = W.hat,
                       clusters = school.id,
                       equalize.cluster.weights = TRUE)
varimp = variable_importance(cf.raw)
selected.idx = which(varimp > mean(varimp))

cf = causal_forest(X[,selected.idx], Y, W,
                   Y.hat = Y.hat, W.hat = W.hat,
                   clusters = school.id,
                   equalize.cluster.weights = TRUE,
                   tune.parameters = "all")
tau.hat = predict(cf)$predictions
```

#### ATE

```{r}
ATE = average_treatment_effect(cf)
paste("95% CI for the ATE:", round(ATE[1], 3),
      "+/-", round(qnorm(0.975) * ATE[2], 3))
```

#### Omnibus tests for heterogeneity

Best linear predictor analysis

```{r}
test_calibration(cf)
```

Compare regions with high and low estimated CATEs

```{r}
high_effect = tau.hat > median(tau.hat)
ate.high = average_treatment_effect(cf, subset = high_effect)
ate.low = average_treatment_effect(cf, subset = !high_effect)
paste("95% CI for difference in ATE:",
      round(ate.high[1] - ate.low[1], 3), "+/-",
      round(qnorm(0.975) * sqrt(ate.high[2]^2 + ate.low[2]^2), 3))
```

Formal test for X1 and X2

```{r}
dr.score = tau.hat + W / cf$W.hat *
  (Y - cf$Y.hat - (1 - cf$W.hat) * tau.hat) -
  (1 - W) / (1 - cf$W.hat) * (Y - cf$Y.hat + cf$W.hat * tau.hat)
school.score = t(school.mat) %*% dr.score / school.size

school.X1 = t(school.mat) %*% X$X1 / school.size
high.X1 = school.X1 > median(school.X1)
t.test(school.score[high.X1], school.score[!high.X1])

school.X2 = (t(school.mat) %*% X$X2) / school.size
high.X2 = school.X2 > median(school.X2)
t.test(school.score[high.X2], school.score[!high.X2])

school.X2.levels = cut(school.X2,
  breaks = c(-Inf, quantile(school.X2, c(1/3, 2/3)), Inf))
summary(aov(school.score ~ school.X2.levels))
```

Formal test for S3

```{r}
school.score.XS3.high = t(school.mat) %*% (dr.score * (X$S3 >= 6)) /
  t(school.mat) %*% (X$S3 >= 6)
school.score.XS3.low = t(school.mat) %*% (dr.score * (X$S3 < 6)) /
  t(school.mat) %*% (X$S3 < 6)

plot(school.score.XS3.low, school.score.XS3.high)
t.test(school.score.XS3.high - school.score.XS3.low)
```

School-wise heterogeneity

```{r}
hist(school.score, xlab = "School Treatment Effect Estimate", main = "")
```


#### ATE sanity check

```{r}
ate.hat = mean(school.score)
se.hat = sqrt(var(school.score) / length(school.score - 1))
print(paste(round(ate.hat, 3), "+/-", round(1.96 * se.hat, 3)))
```


#### Variation in propensity scores

```{r}
DF = X
DF$W.hat = cf$W.hat

boxplot(W.hat ~ S3, data = DF, ylab = "Propensity Score", xlab = "Student Expectation of Success")
lines(smooth.spline(X$S3, cf$W.hat), lwd = 2, col = 4)
```

### 2. Robustness analyses

#### Ignor clusters

```{r}
cf.noclust = causal_forest(X[,selected.idx], Y, W,
                           Y.hat = Y.hat, W.hat = W.hat,
                           tune.parameters = "all")

ATE.noclust = average_treatment_effect(cf.noclust)
paste("95% CI for the ATE:", round(ATE.noclust[1], 3),
      "+/-", round(qnorm(0.975) * ATE.noclust[2], 3))

test_calibration(cf.noclust)

tau.hat.noclust = predict(cf.noclust)$predict
plot(school.id, tau.hat.noclust)

nfold = 5
school.levels = unique(school.id)
cluster.folds = sample.int(nfold, length(school.levels), replace = TRUE)

tau.hat.crossfold = rep(NA, length(Y))
for (foldid in 1:nfold) {
  print(foldid)
  infold = school.id %in% school.levels[cluster.folds == foldid]
  cf.fold = causal_forest(X[!infold, selected.idx], Y[!infold], W[!infold],
                          Y.hat = Y.hat[!infold], W.hat = W.hat[!infold],
                          tune.parameters = "all")
  pred.fold = predict(cf.fold, X[infold, selected.idx])$predictions
  tau.hat.crossfold[infold] = pred.fold
}

cf.noclust.cpy = cf.noclust
cf.noclust.cpy$predictions = tau.hat.crossfold
cf.noclust.cpy$clusters = school.id
test_calibration(cf.noclust.cpy)

Rloss = mean(((Y - Y.hat) - tau.hat * (W - W.hat))^2)
Rloss.noclust = mean(((Y - Y.hat) - tau.hat.noclust * (W - W.hat))^2)
Rloss.crossfold = mean(((Y - Y.hat) - tau.hat.crossfold * (W - W.hat))^2)

c(Rloss.noclust - Rloss, Rloss.crossfold - Rloss)

summary(aov(dr.score ~ factor(school.id)))
```

#### Without fitting propensity score

```{r}
cf.noprop = causal_forest(X[,selected.idx], Y, W,
                          Y.hat = Y.hat, W.hat = mean(W),
                          tune.parameters = "all",
                          equalize.cluster.weights = TRUE,
                          clusters = school.id)
tau.hat.noprop = predict(cf.noprop)$predictions

ATE.noprop = average_treatment_effect(cf.noprop)
paste("95% CI for the ATE:", round(ATE.noprop[1], 3),
      "+/-", round(qnorm(0.975) * ATE.noprop[2], 3))

plot(tau.hat, tau.hat.noprop,
     xlim = range(tau.hat, tau.hat.noprop),
     ylim = range(tau.hat, tau.hat.noprop),
     xlab = "orthogonalized causal forest estimates",
     ylab = "non-orthogonalized causal forest")
abline(0, 1, lwd = 2, lty = 2, col = 4)
```

#### Train forest on school-wise DR scores

```{r}
school.X = (t(school.mat) %*% as.matrix(X[,c(4:8, 25:28)])) / school.size
school.X = data.frame(school.X)
colnames(school.X) = c("X1", "X2", "X3", "X4", "X5",
                    "XC.1", "XC.2", "XC.3", "XC.4")

dr.score = tau.hat + W / cf$W.hat * (Y - cf$Y.hat - (1 - cf$W.hat) * tau.hat) -
  (1 - W) / (1 - cf$W.hat) * (Y - cf$Y.hat + cf$W.hat * tau.hat)
school.score = t(school.mat) %*% dr.score / school.size

school.forest = regression_forest(school.X, school.score)
school.pred = predict(school.forest)$predictions
test_calibration(school.forest)

```

#### Alternative OLS analysis

```{r}
school.DF = data.frame(school.X, school.score=school.score)
coeftest(lm(school.score ~ ., data = school.DF), vcov = vcovHC)
```

```{r}
hist(tau.hat, xlab = "estimated CATE", main = "")

hist(tau.hat.noprop, xlab = "estimated CATE", main = "")

# hist(tau.hat.noclust, xlab = "estimated CATE", main = "",
#      breaks = seq(-0.0, 0.55, by = 0.55 / 25))

boxplot(tau.hat ~ round(X$X1), xlab = "X1", ylab = "estimated CATE")
lines(smooth.spline(4 + X[,"X1"], tau.hat, df = 4), lwd = 2, col = 4)

boxplot(tau.hat ~ round(X$X2), xlab = "X2", ylab = "estimated CATE")
lines(smooth.spline(4 + X[,"X2"], tau.hat, df = 4), lwd = 2, col = 4)

school.avg.tauhat = t(school.mat) %*% tau.hat / school.size

plot(school.avg.tauhat, school.pred, cex = 1.5,
     xlim = range(school.avg.tauhat, school.pred),
     ylim = range(school.avg.tauhat, school.pred),
     xlab = "average CATE estimate in school",
     ylab = "school-wise forest predictions")
abline(0, 1, lwd = 2, lty = 2, col = 4)
```

### 3. Experiment with no orthogonalization

```{r}
n.synth = 1000
p.synth = 10
X.synth = matrix(rnorm(n.synth * p.synth), n.synth, p.synth)
W.synth = rbinom(n.synth, 1, 1 / (1 + exp(-X.synth[,1])))
Y.synth = 2 * rowMeans(X.synth[,1:6]) + rnorm(n.synth)

Y.forest.synth = regression_forest(X.synth, Y.synth)
Y.hat.synth = predict(Y.forest.synth)$predictions
W.forest.synth = regression_forest(X.synth, W.synth)
W.hat.synth = predict(W.forest.synth)$predictions

cf.synth = causal_forest(X.synth, Y.synth, W.synth,
                         Y.hat = Y.hat.synth, W.hat = W.hat.synth)
ATE.synth = average_treatment_effect(cf.synth)
paste("95% CI for the ATE:", round(ATE.synth[1], 3),
      "+/-", round(qnorm(0.975) * ATE.synth[2], 3))

cf.synth.noprop = causal_forest(X.synth, Y.synth, W.synth,
                                Y.hat = Y.hat.synth, W.hat = mean(W.synth))
ATE.synth.noprop = average_treatment_effect(cf.synth.noprop)
paste("95% CI for the ATE:", round(ATE.synth.noprop[1], 3),
      "+/-", round(qnorm(0.975) * ATE.synth.noprop[2], 3))

```

Visualize school-level covariates by treatment heterogeneity
```{r}
school.X.std = scale(school.X)
school.tercile = cut(school.pred,
                     breaks = c(-Inf, quantile(school.pred, c(1/3, 2/3)), Inf))
school.tercile.mat = model.matrix(~ school.tercile + 0)
school.means = diag(1 / colSums(school.tercile.mat)) %*% t(school.tercile.mat) %*% as.matrix(school.X.std)

MM = max(abs(school.means))
HC = heat.colors(21)
school.col = apply(school.means, 1:2, function(aa) HC[1 + round(20 * (0.5 + aa))])

DF.plot = data.frame(tercile=rep(factor(1:3, labels=c("low", "mid", "high")), 9), mean=as.numeric(school.means),
                     feature = factor(rbind(colnames(school.X), colnames(school.X), colnames(school.X))))

ggplot(data = DF.plot, aes(x = feature, y = tercile, fill = mean)) +
    geom_tile() + scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "steelblue") +
    theme(axis.text = element_text(size=12), axis.title = element_text(size=14),
          legend.title = element_text(size=14), legend.text = element_text(size=12)) +
    theme(panel.background = element_blank())

mean(school.X$XC.3)
mean(school.X$XC.3[as.numeric(school.tercile) == 1])
```

CATE by school

```{r}
ord = order(order(school.pred))
school.sort = ord[school.id]

boxplot(tau.hat.noclust ~ school.sort, xaxt = "n",
        xlab = "school", ylab = "estimated CATE")
points(1:76, sort(school.pred), col = 4, pch = 16)
legend("topleft", c("school mean CATE", "CATE w/o clustering"), pch = c(16, 1), col = c(4, 1), cex = 1.5)
```


Note:
setting `equalize.cluster.weights` to TRUE means each school receives equal weight in ATE estimation
